Authentication and Authorization guide

  GrillServer uses authentication model from Hive service.
  The same configuration parameters available in hive can be set for lens server.
  Hive auth documentation is available at:
  {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2} Hive Doc}} and 
  {{{http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH4/4.3.0/CDH4-Security-Guide/cdh4sg_topic_9_1.html} Cloudera doc}}
  
  For enabling LDAP authentication on lens server, admin should set following params in lens-site.xml

*--+--+
|hive.server2.authentication|LDAP|
*--+--+---+--+
|hive.server2.authentication.ldap.url|ldap://host:port/|
