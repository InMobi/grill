  in lens CLI.  All the commands documented below can be seen by typing <<help>>
  from the CLI shell.

* Understanding this document

  Given below are a bunch of available commands in lens cli along with the argumets they expect and the way
  they expect those arguments. This section will give a brief introduction on how to interpret the help of
  commands given below. Arguments to commands can be passed in the following ways:

** Passing Keyword arguments

  In this, all the arguments are passed with arg name and arg value. example:

  <<<command --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2 --arg3 value3 >>>

** Passing list arguments

  In this, arguments are passed without arg names. Directly values will be passed:

  <<<command value1 value2 value3>>>


** Mixing list and keyword arguments

  <<<base command --arg1 value1 [--arg2] value2 [[--arg3] value3] [--arg4 value4] >>>

  The <<<[]>>> notation means <<<optional>>>. So argument <<<arg1>>> has to be passed as keyword argument, <<<arg2>>>
  can be passed either with or without <<<--arg2>>>. arg3 can be omitted, passed without <<<--arg3>>> or passed
  with <<<arg3>>>. arg4 can be omitted, or if passed, it has to be passed with <<<--arg4>>>.


=========================


* LENS Commands


** Argument Passing in LENS

  Lens supports both the approaches of passing arguments but advises the usage of keyword arguments over list arguments.
  Mixing is not generally supported. Keyword args are always supported. In places where all the arguments
  have arg name optional, list arguments are supported. So to re-iterate, list arguments are supported if


  * All args are either like <<<arg2>>> or <<<arg3>>> in the previous section.

  * Arguments are of any type, but there is only one argument of type arg2 or arg3 and that's the argument you intend
     to pass value to.

** Known bugs

  * If all arguments have same value, Something weird will happen.
